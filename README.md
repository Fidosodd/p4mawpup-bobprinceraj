# Directions for installing on your computer:

1. Create a text file in a python 2.7 virtual environment. The name doesn't matter, but it is important to make sure that it's a python file.

2. Copy text from webscraper.py into that text file. That text can be found here:
	https://github.com/bobprinceraj/CS-year-1/blob/master/webscraper.py

3. If you don't have BeautifulSoup4 installed, you'll need that. In the command line, type:
	pip install BeautifulSoup4
	Wait for it to install, then continue to the next part.

4. The program is ready to run! Run the program in whatever environment you like. Feel free to make changes to the URI, html attributes, etc.

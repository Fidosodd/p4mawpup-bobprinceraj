# Directions for installing on your computer:

1. Create a text file in a python 2.7 virtual environment. (If you don't have one and don't know how to set one up, go [here]( https://github.com/clevelandhighschoolcs/p4mawpup-bobprinceraj/blob/master/Virtual%20Environment%20Install%20Instructions).) The name doesn't matter, but it is important to make sure that it's a python file.

2. Copy text from webscraper.py into that text file. That text can be found [here](https://github.com/bobprinceraj/CS-year-1/blob/master/webscraper.py).

3. If you don't have BeautifulSoup4 installed, you'll need that. In the command line, type:
	pip install BeautifulSoup4
	Wait for it to install, then continue to the next part.

4. The program is ready to run! Run the program in whatever environment you like. The script is easy to edit, so feel free to make any changes you like.
